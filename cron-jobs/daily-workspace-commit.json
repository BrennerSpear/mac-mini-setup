If there are no changes, reply with just: SKIP\n4. If there ARE changes:\n\n   a. Stage all changes: git add -A\n\n   b. Run 'git diff --cached' to see the ACTUAL content changes (not just file names)\n\n   c. Create a commit with a descriptive message:\n      ```bash\n      cd ~/.openclaw && git commit -m \"chore(daily): <date> - <1-line summary>\"\n      ```\n\n      Commit message guidelines:\n      - ONLY include structural config changes: new/removed cron jobs, new config keys, new agents, new channel configs, etc.\n      - Do NOT mention value-only updates like lastRunAtMs, nextRunAtMs, lastStatus, lastDurationMs, offsets, updatedAtMs, state changes, or other runtime counters.\n      - Be SPECIFIC about what changed, not generic. Read the diffs to understand the actual content.\n\n   d. The pre-commit hook will block if secrets are detected. If it blocks, report the issue.\n\n   IMPORTANT: This is local-only, do NOT push anywhere.",
