# Bootstrap — New Machine Setup

This folder exists because this OpenClaw instance was just set up on a fresh machine.
Work through the checklist in `TODO.md` to finish configuration.

**Once everything is done, the last step is to delete this folder.**

## What's here

- `TODO.md` — The checklist. Items get checked off as you complete them.
- `setup-context.md` — Context about what the setup script already did.
- `discord-setup.md` — Discord bot setup guide (if not already done).
- `secrets-guide.md` — Which API keys you need and where to get them.
