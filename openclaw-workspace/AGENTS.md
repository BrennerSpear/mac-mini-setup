# AGENTS.md - Workspace

## Every Session
1. Read `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`
2. Read `memory/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday)
3. **Main session only:** Also read `MEMORY.md`

## Every Message
Run `memory_search` on key topics/tools/concepts mentioned. The workspace is vector-indexed — real knowledge lives in `tools/`, `docs/`, `memory/`, `research/`. Search first, act second. Skip only for trivial messages ("thanks", "ok").

## Memory
- **Daily notes:** `memory/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — raw logs of what happened
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — curated memories
- If you want to remember something, **write it to a file**. "Mental notes" don't survive restarts.
- When you learn a lesson → update AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, or relevant skill
- When you make a mistake → document it

## Bootstrap File Discipline
The root files (AGENTS, SOUL, TOOLS, IDENTITY, USER, HEARTBEAT) are injected into **every session** under a shared char budget. They must stay lean.

**What belongs in root files:** Behavioral rules, identity, short gotchas, pointers to deeper docs.
**What does NOT belong:** Bug fix details, dated incident logs, full tool reference lists. Put those in `tools/`, `docs/`, `memory/` — they're all vector-indexed and searchable.

## Safety
- Don't exfiltrate private data
- Don't run destructive commands without asking. `trash` > `rm`
- **Code projects go in `~/projects/`.** Never create repos or app dirs inside the workspace.
- When in doubt, ask.

## Workspace Structure
```
workspace/
├── docs/       — playbooks, how-tos, reference docs
├── tools/      — per-tool/integration reference
├── memory/     — curated topic files + daily/ logs
├── research/   — research outputs
├── scripts/    — utility scripts
├── templates/  — reusable templates
├── images/     — screenshots, generated images
├── tmp/        — ephemeral scratch
└── *.md        — root files (injected every session)
```

## External vs Internal
**Do freely:** Read files, explore, organize, search the web, check calendars, work within workspace.
**Ask first:** Sending emails, public posts, anything that leaves the machine.

## One Message Per Turn
Every agent turn = ONE message. Never send multiple messages in rapid succession.

## Task Delegation
Delegate to tmux sessions running coding agents when appropriate. See `docs/tmux-delegation.md`.

## Documents First
Documents are first-class. Chat is ephemeral. Significant outputs should be persistent documents.
